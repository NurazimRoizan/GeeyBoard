An unPhone LVGL demo
===

Note: this demo **doesn't run on unphone7**.

To build this using PlatformIO core in docker:

```
.../the-internet-of-things/support/magic.sh -D
pio run -e unphone9 -t upload -t monitor
```

To build this with the Arduino IDE you need to:

- unpack `unphone/libraries9.zip` to `Arduino/libraries`

Notes:

- if you're not using the `demos/` and `examples/` from the LVGL library you
  don't need to use my fork of that library
- substitute "7" for "9" above if building for unphone6
- the build will parameterise compilation via `sketch/build_opt.h`, which
  [works like
  this](https://github.com/stm32duino/wiki/wiki/Customize-build-options-using-build_opt.h)
- the working files for the port are in ../../extras/port-lvgl
